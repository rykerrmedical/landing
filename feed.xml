      <title>Scripts Discussion with Richard</title>
      <description>
        In this episode we discuss the idea of creating scripts for learning protocols and refining procedures with Richard Templeman, a flight paramedic in Nevada.  We talk about the development of the idea, outline how we've used it personally, and provide examples of how you can do the same in your own clinical practice.  Let us know what you think and reach out with any questions.<br />
